OBX|1|TX|PROCEDURE^Operative Note||PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.~POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.~PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction internal fixation of left hip fracture with intramedullary nail.~ANESTHESIA: Spinal anesthesia.~IMPLANTS: Synthes Trochanteric Fixation Nail (TFN), 130 degree, 11mm x 340mm.~FINDINGS: Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur with lateral wall involvement.~PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was positioned on the fracture table. The left leg was placed in traction. Closed reduction was performed under fluoroscopic guidance. A 4cm incision was made at the greater trochanter. The piriformis fossa was identified and the entry point created. A guidewire was advanced down the femoral canal. Sequential reaming was performed. The intramedullary nail was inserted. Proximal and distal locking screws were placed. Final fluoroscopic images confirmed satisfactory fracture reduction and hardware positioning. The wound was irrigated and closed in layers.~ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150cc.~COMPLICATIONS: None.~DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. Weight bearing as tolerated with walker.||||||F
